## Our Collaborative Effort

This project was truly a team-driven journey. From exploring economic datasets and policy reports to designing a security-focused simulation, each member brought unique perspectives and commitment to the table. Despite the complexity of the topic, we worked cohesively—dividing tasks thoughtfully, providing feedback constructively, and pushing each other to deliver high-quality results.

We navigated through economic uncertainties, diaspora data, and geopolitical implications of remittance flows, always aiming to ground our work in reality and relevance. Whether it was coding, writing, or designing visuals, our collaboration made each component stronger.
