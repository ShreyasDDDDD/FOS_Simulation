# 🧠 Background: Why This Simulation Matters

## 📌 Setting the Stage

Stablecoins like **Tether (USDT)** were created to bridge the speed of crypto with the reliability of fiat currency. By being pegged to the U.S. dollar, they became a go-to tool for fast, cheap, and borderless money transfers — especially in **remittance-heavy countries** like **Vietnam**.

Over time, Tether became deeply embedded in financial ecosystems around the world — **without the regulatory guardrails** of traditional banking. That dependence raised a crucial question:

> **What happens if the world’s most widely used stablecoin collapses?**

## 🇻🇳 Why Vietnam?

Vietnam is consistently ranked among the top 10 remittance-receiving countries. In 2022 alone, the country received over **$19 billion USD** in remittances, much of it sent digitally. With growing crypto adoption, many Vietnamese families began using **USDT wallets and peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto platforms** to avoid traditional banking fees and delays.

> But in this digital shortcut, a dangerous single point of failure emerged.

## 💣 The Tether Collapse: A Global Shockwave

In this simulation’s narrative, an **exploit drains Tether’s reserves** on April 27, 2025, causing it to lose its 1:1 peg. The crash sets off a chain reaction:

- Remittance-dependent households in Vietnam are left without access to their funds.
- Trust in digital financial platforms evaporates.
- Regulators scramble to respond.
- Global markets reel from the destabilization of crypto-linked assets.

## 🎯 Why This Simulation Now?

As digital currencies gain popularity — and become woven into the financial safety nets of vulnerable communities — we face **new security dilemmas**:

- How do we regulate assets that operate outside national borders?
- Can humanitarian aid and remittances be protected in a decentralized economy?
- What ethical frameworks should guide crisis response?

## 🔍 Learning Focus

This simulation challenges participants to:

- **Analyze risk** in emerging financial technologies.
- **Balance innovation with regulation.**
- **Coordinate across sectors** to manage a cross-border financial crisis.
- **Prioritize human security** in tech-driven disruption.

By engaging in this scenario, you're not just exploring a fictional collapse — you're confronting the real-world tensions between **financial inclusion, digital innovation, and systemic risk.**
