Welcome to the official simulation hub for the **Tether (USDT) Collapse & Remittance Crisis in Vietnam** — a strategic and educational scenario exploring the vulnerabilities of global digital finance, the collapse of stablecoin infrastructure, and its impact on human security.

This simulation puts you in the center of a financial and humanitarian emergency triggered by the depegging of the world's most widely used stablecoin.

---

## 🌏 Scenario Background

On **April 27, 2025**, Tether’s reserves were compromised by a major exploit, triggering a global crisis. As remittance flows into **Vietnam** evaporated, panic spread, regulatory systems buckled, and families were left stranded without support. Participants will assume critical stakeholder roles — from Vietnamese regulators and IMF economists to remittance companies and affected families — and navigate a fast-moving crisis under pressure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Investigate the global economic implications of a stablecoin failure
- Manage cross-sector crisis response and international coordination
- Develop fair, fast, and secure alternatives for digital remittance systems
- Weigh ethical considerations alongside financial and political decisions
